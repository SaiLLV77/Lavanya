**PROFILE**   

Hi, I'm Lavanya Vinnakota  

**ASIC Engineer (SoC Functional Verification)**   

I’m passionate about building high-quality verification environments and developing a deep understanding of **digital design, RTL verification, and chip architecture**.  
My goal is to strengthen my expertise in **SystemVerilog, UVM**, and **industry-standard protocols** by working on hands-on projects and reusable verification components.
  
This GitHub account is where I’ll:  
- Upload **DV-related projects** to sharpen my practical verification skills  
- Build **mini environments** for standard protocols   
- Implement **processor designs** to deepen my understanding of **computer architecture**.  
- Explore **ML for DV** research ideas
